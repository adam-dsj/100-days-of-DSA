**Today's Progress**: Solved [Two Sum] problem

**Thoughts**: Practiced using hash maps to solve problems efficiently. Initially considered a brute-force approach with nested loops, but learned that using a dictionary can reduce time complexity to O(n). Reinforced understanding of how to check for complements while iterating through arrays.
