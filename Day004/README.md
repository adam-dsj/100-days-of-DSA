**Today's Progress**: Solved [Palindromic Substrings] problem

**Thoughts**: The idea of using a left (l) and right (r) pointer with respect to 'i' in a for loop was very interesting, I used a while loop to make sure the l pointer wouldn't give me out of bounds error while I reduced it by 1 each iteration. At first I was confused why my answer was wrong until I considered even numbered palindromes as well. Very fun question. Glad it's over though
