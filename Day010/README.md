**Today's Progress**: Solved [Max Profit] problem

**Thoughts**: At first I used bruteforce, while the solution did work, leetcode wasn't happy and didnt allow it to pass the time complexity constraint. So I had to rethink my strategy. I decided to use a single while loop but with two pointers, I believe it's called the sliding window technique. Really cool trick. I enjoyed this problem.
