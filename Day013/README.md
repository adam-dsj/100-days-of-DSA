**Today's Progress**: Solved [Find minimum in rotated sorted array] problem

**Thoughts**: The question requested that it be solved in O(logn), so that was my hint to use Binary search, however it was in a rotated array, this shouldn't affect binary search since even in a rotated sorted array we will have one on left or one on right that is higher than the middle unless it is the middle, so we can simply check the end points on the left and right of the array and compare it to the middle to know which segment we need to focus on.
