**Today's Progress**: Solved [Clone Graph] problem

**Thoughts**: I learned that using a hashmap is the best way to go about cloning a graph, since it keeps essentially a reference towards each newly created node that we can later on use to assign neighbors to our newly created nodes. I also learned that Map<Node, Node> is not the same as HashMap<Node, Node>
