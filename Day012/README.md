**Today's Progress**: Solved [Maximum Product Subarray] problem

**Thoughts**: This was a tricky problem particularly due to 0's and negative numbers, I came up with the idea that if I hit a zero I will just reset the product and keep going. But then I would run into the issue where I have a negative sandwiched between two high values, so I thought why not scan both ways, since that issue can only occur with odd numbered negatives, so it worked great with my solution beating 100.00% of other run time solutions.
