**Today's Progress**: Solved [Most Water] problem

**Thoughts**: At first I tried a bruteforce approach to this problem, it worked great but the time complexity was too much, it was until after that that I saw a hint that showed it could be done with one while loop and two pointers. Honestly genius! Fun problem.ÃŸ
