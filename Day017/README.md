**Today's Progress**: Solved [Non-overlapping Intervals] problem

**Thoughts**: I used a greedy algorithm to solve this problem, I had to first sort the lists by their end value so I could compare them by if they're greater than the one after it, if so - I remove it essentially and increase the counter. With them being sorted it allows this. My solution didn't have great time complexity but I'll improve it next time around.
