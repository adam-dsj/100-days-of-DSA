**Today's Progress**: Solved [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters] problem

**Thoughts**: Used a sliding window with a HashSet to keep track of unique characters. It was a good exercise in managing pointers and avoiding duplicates efficiently. Learned how shrinking the window helps maintain constraints while keeping the solution O(n).
