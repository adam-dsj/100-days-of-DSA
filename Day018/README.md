**Today's Progress**: Solved [Non-overlapping Intervals] problem

**Thoughts**: I used a greedy approach by first sorting the intervals based on their end times. This allowed me to efficiently compare each interval to the previous one and remove overlaps. If an interval overlapped with the last selected one, I skipped it and incremented a counter. Sorting by end times enabled this strategy, though my solution could be improved in terms of time complexity next time.
