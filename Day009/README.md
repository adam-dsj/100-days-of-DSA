**Today's Progress**: Solved [Merge Two Sorted LinkedLists] problem

**Thoughts**: I feel my solution was too long, but apparently beat 96% of other solutions in runtime speed. I learned that we can do problems like this without creating new ListNodes but instead reference other ones and create a new one solely by reference, really interesting.
