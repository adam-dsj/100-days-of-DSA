**Today's Progress**: Solved [Group Anagrams] problem

**Thoughts**: The difficulty of this problem was coming up with the solution of using a Hashmap to keep Key (sorted word) and value (list of values that when sorted become the key), as well as working with the Hashmap of lists, was quite confusing but worked.
