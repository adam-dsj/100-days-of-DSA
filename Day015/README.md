**Today's Progress**: Solved [Rotate Matrix] problem

**Thoughts**: This problem required the special use of transpose method, which then allowed for a simpler and more elegant solution. We also had to consider that the size of the matrix was non static, therefore we had to create the method arbitrarly.
