**Today's Progress**: Solved [Word Break] problem

**Thoughts**: I found this problem very straight forward at first, but then ran into issues with edge cases, and it forced me to rethink my entire approach, i saw online later that people were solving this using DP, after some research on how DP works, and quite some time, I came with a solution that passed all leetcode tests. Interesting problem.
